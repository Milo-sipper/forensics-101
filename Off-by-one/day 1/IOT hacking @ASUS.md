## ASUS routers and vulnerability chaining
- Overflow historical vulnerabilities 
- cfgserver heap overflow 
- httpd auth bypass
> Asus routers are commonplace and their firmware can be downloaded from their website (decrypted). We can then use tools to explore further 

##### When digging further:
cfgserver -> used for networking where a heap overflow can be caused 
http auth bypass -> allows us to fake a login as an unauthenthicated user

##### vulnerability discovery and impact 
too drunk to write
