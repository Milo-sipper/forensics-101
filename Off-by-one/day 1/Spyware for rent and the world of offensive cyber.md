## Geopolitics of offensive operations 
*reminds me of geog paper 3 *
#### USA
- Loved it (CIA) but worried about the usage of spyware against US citizens, hence they got the company to ban the usage of the spyware on American phone numbers
- FBI got around it lmao
#### China
- Uses private companies to conduct spying
- 0-days are reported to Chinese state government first, not allowed to sell in international markets 
- Foreign spyware rarely used; China has developed their own equivalent
#### Russia
- Government is behind a lot of things but they use proxies 
- Hybrid attacks (cyber / regular attacks)
#### Israel
- Large tech market 
- Government funded and growing
#### Italy 
- Uses spyware to fight the mafia, #1 priority
- Spying on other people is a secondary priority
