So, you want to learn forensics huh? I wonder what made you think of picking this dead cat. Well, just so happens, me. 
###### whoami?
-  CCT batch of 2025
- ``just_cat_the_firefly``
-  Ryan (you may know me by whatever sean't calls me)
###### why am i making this?
I  am making this because I want to to pass down forens to the next gen (as it stands, I am the only forens main in CCT). Another reason is because I am year 6 in 2025, and about to step down (I would have probably disappeared by the time you are reading this), and i owe a lot to CCT. I hope by writing this guide, i hope i can help future forens mains have a less painful journey when learning forens.

I know you have a lot of questions, and yep ill answer them in due time. But like before you continue, i would just want to let u know what you really are getting yourself into
## Forenshits is:
1. Very guessy
2. You need to be a good guesser
3. Rlly fun once you start to get the hang of it
4. Might want to make you kys 

So, while sometimes it may seem hard to embrace forensics as a category you would like to embark on (i highly advise y'all to main this as a secondary cat and not your main as some CTFs ~~**ahem ahem greyctf**~~ don't have forensics, rather they clump it into `misc` or something else), I still think forensics can be broken down into several distinct types of challenges. 

In this guide, i will walk you through the how's of forensics and how to solve challenges. The basic order of how you should read this guide can be expressed as: 

$$Introduction → Basics → Disk/Pcap/Volatility/Steganogrpahy → Guessing$$ 
source to prove that i'm not a total con artist: (thank you @genericuser my goat for helping me through many of these)
