**Made with obsidian, so use obsidian and enable plugins for the best viewing experience**


Notes which I have made, may be wrong. AFAIK, symlinks and pasted images do not render in github, so ``git clone`` this repo and use that folder as your Obsidian vault. 

*U can technically use obsidian plugins to make it readable on git, but i'm too lazy to implement that. Someone do it and make a pull request or smth
