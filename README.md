**Made with obsidian, so use obsidian and enable plugins for the best viewing experience**


Notes which I have made, may be wrong. AFAIK, symlinks and pasted images do not render in github, so ``git clone`` this repo and use that folder as your Obsidian vault.


*i realised there are tools to convert symlinks and pasted images into readable format but im lazy 

*U can technically use obsidian plugins to make it readable on git, but i'm too lazy to implement that. Someone do it and make a pull request or smth
