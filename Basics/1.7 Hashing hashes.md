A **hash** is a fixed-size string of characters (often numbers and letters) that represents data, created by a **hashing algorithm**. It’s kind of like a fingerprint for a piece of data—no two different pieces of data should (ideally) have the same hash[^2]

In forensics and in general, hashes are given out so you can check that the piece of software you have downloaded matches the hash of the intended software,  confirming that you have downloaded the correct piece of software. In forensics, rarely, you would be given a hash to crack. 

#### Tools 
**[Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat)** is a great tool when cracking hashes with a dictionary (most likely **[rockyou.txt](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt)**) 
##### Usage:
``hashcat -m [hash_mode] -a [attack_mode] -o [output_file] [hash_file] [wordlist]``
For example:
- `m 1400` → **SHA-256** hash mode
    
- `-a 0` → **Straight** attack (basic wordlist attack)
    
- `-o found.txt` → Output cracked passwords here
    
- `hash.txt` → File containing the hash(es)
    
- `rockyou.txt` → Wordlist file (commonly used)
###### Other modes:
