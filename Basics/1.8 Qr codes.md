QR codes often come in many types of forms 
for example
**this is a qr code

These are also qr / barcodes

The common formats for QR codes would be:**
1. The original QR code (And its versions) 
> 		you would see this for 90% of qr-related challenges
2. PDF417
3. Maxi-code
4. Intelligent barcodes
5. iQR codes

## Features of qr codes 
Since most qr-code challenges would be based on the regular qr code and its different versions, this article's contents would be with respect to the original qr code, developed by Denso Wave.

The QR code renders black as 1 and white as 0 in binary btw.

With reference to the QR code featured above, the main hallmark of the QR code would be its ==finder patterns==. It is a set of 3 boxes located on the top left, top right and bottom left of a QR code. Its job is to help ==detect the presence of the qr code, and align it.== 
###### Why is it able to be detected?
This is because even when the QR code is viewed from any angle, the widths of alternating colours will be in the ratio of 1:1:3:1:1.[^1]

>*(Not to be confused about the ==alignment patterns==, which accounts for distorts when viewing the QR code, for example when viewing the QR code from an angle)*

Alignment (marked as timing marks on the image) marks are used to further help align the grid, making for detection of larger QR codes possible. 

Spacing chunks would just act as a buffer for the easier detection of the finder pattens, and format bits / chunks help contain information for the version of QR code being used (different versions can store different amounts of data)
###### Error correcting within the QR code 
QR codes also come with error correcting, and come in different sizes 
	- Low, corrects up to when 7% of data is corrupted
	- Medium, corrects up to when 15% of data is corrupted
	- Quartile, corrects up to when 25% of data is corrupted
	- High, corrects up to when 30% of data is corrupted.
The error correcting is done through the addition of redundant information when encoding the data into the final QR code. This is also the reason why when there is something covering up a bit of the QR code, it can still be scanned 
## How would we solve qr-code related challenges?
We can solve this by first putting the damaged QR code into a tool such as **[QRazybox](https://merri.cx/qrazybox/)**. It is a powerful tool to help either remake QR codes or help find finder patterns, allowing us to decode the QR code and give us the flag.

### How to use QRazybox
 So here is a quick tutorial about how to use QRazybox:
![[Pasted image 20250327101311.png]]
1. Select new and then select (then select import from image). This will load the QR code into the editor 
2. Enter editor mode. This would allow you to inspect

#### Challenge walkthrough: REconstructQ #STF20
We are presented with a torn QR code which when imported into QRazybox, will not be scanned. The QR code is also evidently missing some of its finder patterns.

There is technically 2 ways in which we can solve this challenge 
##### Method 1: Intended solve: 
1. We would assume that maybe there is some hidden challenge, so we put it into fotoforensics
2. We discover there are transparent (hidden) pixels which actually reveals the entire image, including the rest of the QR code. 
3. Profit.

##### Method 2: Actually fixing the QR code manually:
Since most QR codes wont have a "cheat" to allow us to find the rest of the QR code this easily, we would have to rely on manually fixing th QR code. This can be done by 
1. Tracing the QR code out in a spreadsheet editor 
2. Create a finder pattern
