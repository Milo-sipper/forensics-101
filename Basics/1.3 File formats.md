A lot of what you learnt in [[1.2 Hex editing, Binary, decimal, and base 64]] can be used to identify file formats and hence figure out how to progress onto the next step of the challenge 
## What are file formats?
File formats are often thought of as just the trailing letters after the period in a file. But in reality file formats represent the ==magic bytes== present in the file. 
###### hold on what are magic bytes??
- Magic bytes are a string of hex which dictates what format a file is. They are always the same and can often be the first clue you get when repairing a file. ==Found at the start of every file.==
- A full list can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures. Compare the magic hex bytes against the one in the challenge file to determine whether they are the same file format. Or use `file` like a degen.

## Common file formats:
### Portable Network Graphics (PNGs)
Probably tied with jpg/jpegs as the most common file formats found in image forensics. The main shtick about PNG's is that it is divided into chunks.

**it may look overwhelming but its not that deep u don't need to know everything for now, but see how there are magic bytes at the start of the file and how there is a huge IHDR chunk

The main chunks you would need to look out for would be 
1. IHDR chunk → always the first chunk to appear in a PNG and it consists of the file width, height, CRC (cyclic redundancy checksum)
2. IDAT chunk → Contains pixel data of the image.
3. IEND chunk → Signifies the end of a PNG file. 
*Adding on to point 1, there are a host of challenges which play on the manipulation of the width and height of the png.* Check out PCRT, its a decent tool for repairing PNGs.
### Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEGs)
The thing with JPEGs is u literally only need to watch out for the magic bytes so like the magic bytes, which is ``FF D8 FF E0 00 10 4A 46   49 46 00 01``.

Unlike PNGs, JPEG's do not have chunks, rather 90% of all challenges would involve fixing the file header.

**note that Huffman tables is just the compression method used for the image, hence its not important**
### Example challenge: Image Repair (HACK@AC 2021) 
Steps / thought process
1. I open the file and it is un-openable as the image does not render
2. My first instinct would hence to put it into a hex editor to see what is wrong. After a cursory glance, we can immediately see how the first 4 bytes are off (should be ePNG) and the IDHR chunk is wrong. (IEND is fine, hence we do not care about it as we don't need to fix it)

3. We edit out the chunks and then we save the image
4. The image displays and I get the flag
5. Profit.
