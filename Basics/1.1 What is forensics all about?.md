So basically, digital forensics is similar to real forensics. You basically have to uncover clues or information from a piece of evidence to present a case to the judge. In this case, your case would be the flag checker on any CTF and your evidence would be a correct flag
## Prerequisites
Thats the beauty of forens, there is a low skill floor. Only basic coding / linux skills are needed, although most harder forens challenges would require some scripting to solve, so it would be good to get good at python. 

As with every other CTF category you will need some software, but i will link all the relevant software in this set of notes. 

## Mindset? 
This will be covered under [[1.2 To look when lost.]].


## Where can i go find challenges to practice?
There are lots of CTF's to practice forensics challenges, if not Dunhack.me should also be a good place to practice as it has a plethora of forensics challenges
