Apart from messing up the image, challenges can also hide data in a file's ==metadata== / or carve files into it, similar to a matryoshka doll.

## What is file metadata?
File metadata holds the information of the image. They hold, for example, 
![[Pasted image 20250320114648.png]]
### Where is this metadata stored?
File metadata is important for both image forensics and potentially disk forensics. In images such as PNGs and JPEGs, it is stored in chunks (EXIF) and split into multiple chunks for PNGs.

For stuff like file systems, they are stored in specific files (MFT for NTFS, inodes in ext4)
### Why is this important?
This is important as we can hence use tools to extract and view the metadata, which would allow us to be able to find the flag.
I normally use:
- **[Aperisolve](https://www.aperisolve.com/)
- **[FotoForensics](https://fotoforensics.com/)
- ``exiftool``

## File Carving 
Another way they can hide files is hiding files inside files. This is often done on PNGs as JPEGs are *lossy* and hence don't retain inside information well. How do you know whether file carving is taking place?

Well, it's time to guess and check, but there is one telltale sign -- which is when you spot a large amount of **trailing** data. For the case of PNGs, it is just data after the IEND chunk which could signify the presence of something else. 
### Tools for file carving 
I normally use:
- **[Aperisolve](https://www.aperisolve.com/)
- **[FotoForensics](https://fotoforensics.com/)
- ``binwalk
- `zsteg`
- `outguess`
- `foremost
##### Example usage 
``binwalk -dd "*" file / binwalk -e file`` 
`zsteg xxxx.png / zsteg -a xxxx.png`
so when we use file carving, we can find files inside files hehe. This would allow us to get the flag. 

### Challenge walkthrough: RED
We are presented with this file, red.png. It opens to a red square. Apart from this, I don't know anything else about this. Here is my thought process
1. One of the clues asks us to view the metadata. This is also compounded with another clue to search up the RGB (Red Green Blue) of the image.
2. I hence dump it into **[Aperisolve](https://www.aperisolve.com/)** as it is a one stop shop of many image forensics tools 
3. Zsteg reveals to us a base64 encoded string which decodes to the flag
