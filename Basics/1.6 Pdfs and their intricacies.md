A PDF file stands for Portable Document Format. It is a file which often contains documents. 
## What you need to know 
Something ==new==: you can run JS programs in pdfs. This can allow for the user to gain control of  a system, for example it can be configured to run code as soon as it is opened, this could lead to your system being comprimised.

For example 
```
app.alert("hewwo", 3);
```
would 
-  show a popup titled "hewwo"
    
- The second parameter `3` makes the alert display an information icon (you can also use `0`, `1`, `2` for different icons).

## Common CTF challenges involving PDFs
1. Cracking locked PDFs with dictionaries
2. Extract words hidden by a black bar -- just highlight all the words and copy paste it onto a clean document 
3. Hiding JavaScript scrips or ofcuscated code in a pdf 
4. ``Strings | grep`` 
5. File carving

#### Mindset when tackling these PDF challenges.
Often when i see challenges I do not know how to do, I would often think back to similiar challenges which i have done before. If I do not know how to do a particular challenge, i would then look at the challenge description or try some basic approaches such as strings grep or ``exiftool`` to tackle these challenges.
