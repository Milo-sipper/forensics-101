This covers both DNS and SSH tunnelling

So recently, i tried accessing the [EE drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qs_kX89lHnGBNhoofkvbEHAFmWKKaTaT/view) and realised the school's sysadmins restricted us from accessing the EE's outside the school network. Hence, today i will be teaching you what SSH tunnelling is to access these websites for cheap. (Also DNS tunnelling for CTF)

## SSH tunnelling?
Basically SSH tunnelling is port forwarding (i think?). In the context of SSH, **port forwarding _is_ tunneling**. This is because you're creating a secure "tunnel" through an SSH connection to forward traffic from one port to another.
