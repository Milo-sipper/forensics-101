This covers both DNS and SSH tunnelling

So recently, i tried accessing the [EE drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qs_kX89lHnGBNhoofkvbEHAFmWKKaTaT/view) and realised the school's sysadmins restricted us from accessing the EE's outside the school network. Hence, today i will be teaching you what SSH tunnelling is to access these websites for cheap. (Also DNS tunnelling for CTF)

## SSH tunnelling?
Basically SSH tunnelling is port forwarding (i think?). In the context of SSH, **port forwarding _is_ tunnelling**. This is because you're creating a secure "tunnel" through an SSH connection to forward traffic from one port to another.

for example, if i were to access a website which is only available on the school network, i could **technically** access that shit via running this command (assuming u have a laptop / machine in school)
```
ssh -L 8443:192.168.10.42:443 user@ssh.company.com

then visit: https://localhost:8443
```
Basically it allows you to securely connect to `ssh.company.com` as `user`, and create a **tunnel** from my local computer's port `8443` to the internal machine at `192.168.10.42` on port `443` (HTTPS).

*replace ssh.company.com with the website that you want to access. Normally HTTP runs on port 80 whereas HTTPS runs on port 443. 

### Key commands 
- `ssh user@host` → login to a remote machine
    
- `ssh -L local:remote:port` → **port forwarding** (access private sites)
    
- `ssh -D port user@host` → **SOCKS proxy** (browse through remote network)
    
- `scp file user@host:` → transfer files
    
- `ssh-keygen` → make SSH keys (for passwordless login)
##### ssh-keygen
Split into public and private keys, both let you have access to remote servers
Created with ``ssh-keygen`` 
==**you** keep the private key while the server keeps the public key==

## DNS tunnelling 
Basically the same thing but on the DNS protocol, where you are "appending" data to DNS queries [[1.01 DNS, TCP-IP and MAC addresses]]. DNS runs on port 53.

### How do we normally do this?
We use [iodine](https://github.com/yarrick/iodine/) to setup a VPS (Virtual private server) to perform DNS exfiltration 

go read the iodine github repo i don't know how to summarise ts
