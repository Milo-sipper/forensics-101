## What are ports?
Internet ports are are like "channels" to help ==organise network traffic==. There are 65535 ports in the internet, and this is because they are the 16-bit unsigned integers in the TCP and UDP headers. 

Even though only 1 port can bind at the same port on the same **IP-address** and **protocol (UDP / TCP)**, ports can be reused when the connection is closed, or when on different protocols / IP addresses. 

| Port range    | Name                  | Use case                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## What is port forwarding?
Port forwarding is when you forward your port and IP of maybe a certain process to a central port somewhere else. For example, lets say you are on port ``8080`` and on ip ``192.168.0.1`` and your website is hosted on port ``8080`` and ip ``203.0.113.5``. Port forwarding allows you to connect to port ``8080`` and ip ``203.0.113.5`` from your home router IP, displaying the webpage.

### TCP vs UDP port forwarding?
Mostly the same as the material covered in [[1.01 DNS, TCP-IP and MAC addresses]]
##### Use Cases:
- **TCP Port Forwarding**:
    - Web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS)
        
    - Email (SMTP, POP3, IMAP)
        
    - File transfers (FTP)
        
    - Remote desktop applications (RDP)
        
- **UDP Port Forwarding**:
    - Online gaming
        
    - VoIP (Voice over IP)
        
    - DNS queries
        
    - Streaming (e.g., video, voice)
