## What is Aircrack?
- Aircrack-ng is a network software suite consisting of a detector, packet sniffer, WEP and WPA/WPA2-PSK cracker and analysis tool for 802.11 wireless LANs.
- Aircrack is split into the following tools:

| Tool               | Use case                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **aircrack-ng**    | The main tool for cracking WEP/WPA/WPA2-PSK keys using captured packets.            |
| **airodump-ng**    | Captures Wi-Fi packets and saves them for analysis (`.cap`/`.pcap` files)           |
| **aireplay-ng**    | Generates or injects traffic to accelerate WEP/WPA cracking (e.g., deauth attacks). |
| **airmon-ng**      | Enables monitor mode on Wi-Fi interfaces for packet sniffing.                       |
| **airbase-ng**     | Creates fake access points (evil twin attacks).                                     |
| **airdecap-ng**    | Decrypts WEP/WPA-captured files if you have the key                                 |
| **packetforge-ng** | Crafts encrypted packets for injection (used in WEP attacks).                       |
*The important ones for CTFs are airmon, aircrack and airdecap. 
	Also, i'm pretty sure airmon doesn't work on WSL as it does not have access to the physical hardware, since WSL is  virtualised linux on windows.

## How to use aircrack?
``man aircrack-ng`` ‚Üí ==documentation, RTFM==
### aircrack-ng
Usage:
```
aircrack-ng [options] <capture file(s)>
```
*capture files are normally .cap files (NOT .PCAP)*

| Common options | Param.      | Description                                                                                                                                                     |

| -a             | `amode`     | Force attack mode (1 = static WEP, 2 = WPA/WPA2-PSK)                                                                                                            |
| -e             | `essid`     | If set, all IVs from networks with the same ESSID will be used. This option is also required for WPA/WPA2-PSK cracking if the ESSID is not broadcasted (hidden) |
| -b             | `bssid`     | Long version --bssid. Select the target network based on the access point's MAC address                                                                         |
| -p             | `nbcpu`     | On SMP systems: # of CPU to use. This option is invalid on non-SMP systems                                                                                      |
| -q             | N/A         | Enable quiet mode (no status output until the key is found, or not)                                                                                             |

| -l             | `file name` | (Lowercase L, ell) logs the key to the file specified. Overwrites the file if it already exists                                                                 |

So for example, for if we want to crack a wifi network encrypted by WPA-PSK, we would use this command:
```
aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt capture_file-01.cap
```

This allows us to decrypt the gibberish in the .cap file to human readable text.
```
airdecap-ng -w found_password  capture_file-01.cap
```



#### Example challenge: Hack me :)
We get a .cap file which when opened in Wireshark, reveals this:
![[Pasted image 20250410225900.png]]
**Literal garbage**üóëÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è (encrypted)

So my thought process is as follows:
1. We somehow need to make this data human readable (The data should signal to you that it is currently encrypted using a passcode)
2. We should use Aircrack-ng  for this
3. Because they did not give us the password, the logical conclusion would be to bruteforce it

So i then boot up aircrack-ng and type in the standard command ``aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt router.pcap-01.cap``
- This enters a menu which would start "guessing" passwords. 
- This is what it is supposed to look like:
![[Pasted image 20250410230716.png ]]
- When the correct password is found, do not use the passphrase directly 
- Rather, i used
```
airdecap-ng -k master_key router.pcap-01.cap
```
	- k specifies the use of the master key as WPA2-PSK files are of certain lengths. I got the error "Invalid WEP key length. [5,13,16,29,61]". Whoops.

This returns a decrypted .cap file, and after opening, it can be verifiably decrypted. For the last step, just "export objects" to get the flag.
