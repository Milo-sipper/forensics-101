What is networking? Basically how your internet works 

## DNS (Domain Name System)
- DNS is like the "phonebook of the internet"; Basically we visit websites and websites communicate with each other wi2th [ip addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/internet-protocol/) . DNS basically helps "translate" these domain names to IP addresses so webpages are able to retrieve data 

So for example when you load into a webpage, your computer would go and ask a few servers for information before loading the actual webpage
1. DNS recursor. It will go do the job of asking different serves for information (IP adresses)
2. The DNS resolver can "ask" at multiple places (in order of pirority)
	1. Local cache stored on your computer "``ipconfig /displaydns``"
	2.  Forwarders? 
	3. Root servers
	4. TLD (Top level domain) servers
	5. Authoritative nameservers
3. The webpage displays

### Breakdown
- A Root server basically directs shit to the TLS server. IT DOES NOT STORE IP CACHE. It would point the recourser to the TLD server
- A TLD server basically a TLD (so like .com or .net), so it stores information about the IP addresses of  sites which use this top level domain. If it does not have the IP, it would ask the authoritative servers (**ONLY CONTAINS NS RECORDS)
- An authoritative server is the bottom of the DNS hirechary and is the last to be querired. However, it stores and serves **official DNS records** for domains under its authority. Split into master and slave for extra security

### DNS zones

DNS zones are text files showing all the DNS records in the zone 


## TCP-IP
- TCP-IP is a more simplified version of [[1.03 The OSI model]]. It consists of 4 main layers 

![[Pasted image 20250403125147.png]]

### Application
Basically it is the topmost layer where apps interact with the network
**Protocols**
1. HTTP / HTTPS (Hypertext transfer protocol + secure) 
2. FTP (File transport protocol)
3. DNS (We covered this above)
4. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) → handles emails 
### Transport
The transport layer allows for data transmission
**Protocols**
1. UDP (User datagram protocol)
2. TCP (Transmission control protocol)
3. QUIC 
#### TCP vs UDP
TCP prioritises for data reliability and accuracy by having a SYSACK & ACK call to ensure the packet's integrity. This result in lower packet loss and ==error correction== 

UDP prioritises speed over reliability, resulting in loss of packets occasionally and ==no error correction==
##### Protocols which rely on TCP and UDP 
###### TCP
1. HTTPS / HTTP
2. FTP
3. SSH (Secure Shell)
###### UDP
1. DNS / DHCP (Dynamic host control protocol)
2. NTP (Network time protocol)
3. VoIP (RTP for videos / audio, SIP to answer / cancel calls)
4. Tello drones when they send thier video feed

### Internet
The internet protocol allows for routing packets (covered in [[1.02 What are packets?]] ) across different IP adresses

**Protocols**
 1. IP (Internet Protocol) 
 2. ICMP (Internet control network protocol) → error reporting
 3. ARP (Address resolution protocol) → maps IP addresses to MAC addresses in a local network, uses IP addresses
### Network access 
The last layer before the physical hardware. Hence, the protocols used here are meant 
- Assign MAC adresses 
- Chop the data into frames to be sent via Ethernet and Wifi
- Error handling by adding the CRC
- Conversion of data to electrical and radio waves
**Protocols**
1. Ethernet
2. Wifi
3. ARP (Also here because it is a hybrid protocol, uses MAC addresses here)
4. PPP (Point to point) ??????????????

## MAC adresses
MAC addresses are short for **medium access control address**, and they are unique identifiers which are assigned by ARP to map IP addresses to MAC addresses. All devices in theory have their own unique MAC addresses. 

MAC addresses can tell us some information, for example:

*yeah i have no idea what this shit is*

Computers would normally have 2 MAC addresses, one for Bluetooth and one for Wifi
