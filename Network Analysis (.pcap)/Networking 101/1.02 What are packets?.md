## What are packets?
Network packets are defined as a formatted unit of data which is sent over a network. 
> There are many types of packets which are used in all levels of the TCP-IP framework

## What is inside a packet?
A packet normally consists of 
1. A header 
2. A payload
3. A tail (trailer)

## What kinds of packets are there?
1. TCP packets 
2. UDP packets 
3. IP
4. ARP
5. HTTP / FTP
6. About every protocol you can think of 


#### Example: IP (Internet Protocol) packets
IP packets are packets which are sent under the IP protocol 
- [ip header](https://networklessons.com/cisco/ccna-routing-switching-icnd1-100-105/ipv4-packet-header) (The different fields are able to be viewed in Wireshark) <br>

- The payload can be up to 65,536 bytes but the MTU (maximum transmission unit) is 1500 bytes. This allows for error correcting which allows for error correction though flags, preventing fragmentation. 

## How can i view packets?
- You can view them in a tool such as Wireshark, covered in [[1.2 A general Wireshark tutorial]]
