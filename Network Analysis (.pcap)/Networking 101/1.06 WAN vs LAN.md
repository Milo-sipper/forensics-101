## WAN (Wide area network)
A WAN is a wide area network which connects different LANs, enabling long distance communication.

Imagine your house and workplace to be a LAN, hosting everything which u need to survive, whereas the public infrastructure acts as a WAN to connect the 2 LAN's together  
## LAN (Local area network)
A LAN is a computer network which connects devices within a limited geographical area (think your wifi network)
